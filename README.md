# RubiksCubeSolver
The goal of this project is to design an AI model capable of solving a Rubik’s Cube. I created a Rubik’s Cube interface capable of accepting user and automated input in QT Creator using C++. The interface will be connected to a neural network model which will predict the number of moves required to solve a cube. Together these will allow a user to set the cube to some state and retrieve moves that can solve it. This project is a work in progress.
